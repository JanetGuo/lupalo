fb.getLoginStatus in tdfriendselector not working.
Needed to turn off secure browsing.

Q: Why can't I play games on facebook?
Every time i try to lay a game on facebook it says:
"Secure browsing is not supported
This application does not yet support secure browsing (HTTPS)."


A: you need to turn off secure browsing
Account Settings >> Security
https://www.facebook.com/settings?tab=seâ€¦
most of the apps dont work in secure mode
